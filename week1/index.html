    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Javascripts localStorage can be used to save key/value pairs in the web browser. The data is stored even if the
        browser is closed.<br>
        Syntax for saving is as follows: localStorage.setItem(“key”, “value”);<br>
        Values can then be accessed through grabbing the info via key<br>
        Syntax for this: var newVariable = localStorage.getItem(“key”);<br>

        <h2>Mobile first tips</h2>
        <p>
        Mobile first = better functionality<br>
        Loading must be quick (less steps = better)<br>
        Reachability matters when designing for touch (Key items must be in easy to reach places)<br>
        <br>
        Increase speed by reducing image usage, use svg/webfonts, optimize CSS and JS files.<br>
        <br>
        Placement matters<br>
        (Easier access can lead to a higher perception of speed, and higher engagement / satisfaction.)<br>
        Fixing “good enough” is what makes a website great.<br>
        <br>
        Tricks for input bars on mobile devices<br>
        Float labels can be useful because the labels are inside the input box, and moves out of the way but is still<br>
        visible when typed (also saves space on the screen)<br>
        Make checkboxes and input boxes bigger (easier to select with thumbs on mobile)<br>
        Don’t show fields that aren’t required. Have them appear corresponding to options selected<br>
        Enabling autocomplete helps make info easier to fill out<br>
        Have passwords toggle visibility (helps prevent errors when filling out on mobile)<br>
        Brad Frost credit card input (look it up!)<br>
        Bring numpad rather than mobile text. (easier to input numbers)<br>
        Linking phone numbers on website make it much easier for mobile devices<br>
        Mobile ads should be small and simple<br>
        Small ads could get bigger upon click.<br>
        Ads could be videos<br>
        Do not use pop ups on ads (very annoying)<br>
