    <h4>Strict Mode</h4>
    <p>Strict mode can be enabled by adding the following to the first line of a js file:</p>
    <p><strong>'use strict';</strong></p>
    <br>
    <h4>Importance of IF statements for detection</h4>
    <p>It's important to utilize if statements for checking to see if for example, a method from a module should be called.</p>
    <p> By using an if statement, it prevents errors from occuring if it is not found</p><br>
    <p>Heres how that would look: if (window.holoDeck) {}</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Try, Catch, and Finally</h4>
    <p><strong>Try</strong> can be used when code may or may not work. <strong>Catch</strong> is used to trigger the result if try does not work. <strong>Finally</strong> is 
        utilized after either try or catch triggers.
